# Leaf-Disease-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

Plant disease detection using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) involves training a deep learning model on a dataset of images containing healthy and diseased plants. 
The CNN learns to extract meaningful features from the images and accurately classify them into different disease categories. 

The model's layers perform convolution, pooling, and classification tasks, enabling it to detect subtle patterns indicative of diseases.

 This approach enhances early detection and facilitates timely interventions, aiding farmers and agricultural experts in preventing widespread crop losses. 

The combination of CNN's powerful image processing capabilities and vast datasets empowers a robust and scalable solution for efficient plant disease diagnosis.
